## Client

The client is built with React and TypeScript. It uses the Context API for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Directory Structure

- `src/constants`: Contains the action types for the reducer.
- `src/interface`: Contains the TypeScript interfaces used in the project.
- `src/utils`: Contains utility functions, such as notifications.

## Server

The server is built with Express and Node. It provides a REST API for managing tasks.

### Directory Structure

- `src/routes`: Contains the routes for the API.
- `src/controllers`: Contains the controllers for handling requests.

## API Design

The API is designed to handle the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/create`: Create a new task.
